# Overview

Bedtime Boss lets the user enter in a bedtime for themselves. An alarm will then go off at the specified time, indicating that the user needs to go to bed. The app is not fully functional at this time because I am still working on the alert function. Eventually, the user can either snooze the alarm, for 15 minutes or hit the “getting ready” button which will snooze for 30 minutes.

This is the first App I have ever created and I am using it to help me explore app development and learn about React Native.
